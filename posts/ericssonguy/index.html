<p>I met an guy on tinder a few days ago. He works at Ericsson so I refer to him as Ericsson guy here.<br>
We first matched on the last Friday night, which was an interesting day for me. That afternoon I found a nice psychologist but then he unmatched me immediately. I deleted my account and started a new one. Soon later on, I saw my ex boyfriend coming out on his ins - he is gay. I felt upset, disappointed, terrible.</p>
<p>I subcribed the tinder gold to match a guy whatever he gives me. Then that was when I found ericsson guy. I don&rsquo;t recall much about my first impression, just he had graduated from Uppsala and he had a job at ericsson. I later learned that he had a nation flag on his page was french. Our initial conversation was quite pleasant and he was polite, making me feel like he genuinely liked me. After getting to know him better, I realized he was exactly my type and the best type of guy for me.</p>
<p>I ended the conversation that night feeling too sleepy to continue, but couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about him over the next few days. On Sunday, I felt like I couldn&rsquo;t hide my feelings anymore and reached out to him again. However, a few days later, I scared him away with a long text.</p>
