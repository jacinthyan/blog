				<p>#Diary</p>
<p>I have come to understand that life is not as straightforward as it should be. I have decided that during the years between 25 and 30, I need to connect more with the real world to reach a new stage in my life, to break my linear growth pattern - where I want, I strive for it, I attain it. Something has to happen, to shake me from my complacency and force me to re-evaluate my beliefs.</p>
<p>As fate would have it, that something did happen. In the year 25, I was scammed by people pretending to be police, and they took all of my and my mother’s savings. All the efforts about money, in the recent 30 years, were lost. I have been familiar with the pattern of severe loss when my father was diagnosed with cancer. He was also a lawyer. I kind of thought that the reason I trusted these “police,” it was like my father had come back in a way to save me, who in a way to lead me to come out of my lost mind.</p>
