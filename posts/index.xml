      <description>Tinder guy 01 I met an guy on tinder a few days ago. He works at Ericsson so I refer to him as Ericsson guy here.
We first matched on the last Friday night, which was an interesting day for me. That afternoon I found a nice psychologist but then he unmatched me immediately. I deleted my account and started a new one. Soon later on, I saw my ex boyfriend coming out on his ins - he is gay.</description>

      <description>Lyrics Every night in my dreams
I see you, I feel you
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance
And spaces between us
You have come to show you go on
Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more, you open the door
And you&amp;rsquo;re here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on
Love can touch us one time</description>

      <description>Diary I have come to understand that life is not as straightforward as it should be. I have decided that during the years between 25 and 30, I need to connect more with the real world to reach a new stage in my life, to break my linear growth pattern - where I want, I strive for it, I attain it. Something has to happen, to shake me from my complacency and force me to re-evaluate my beliefs.</description>
